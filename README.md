# Augmonted

Augmonted (Android Application) - Voted 1st App in Winter 2015 in Mobile Development Course (CSE 190)

http://augmonted.github.io

Brief Summary:
Augmonted is an augmented reality based combat game, featuring our original Augmon creatures as characters trained 
by the amount of steps you take calculated through a pedometer. 
We built this game with the idea of our favorite childhood games in mind, such as Pokemon and Tamagotchi. 
Our goal was to create a unique experience never done before by implementing our game with augmented reality.
In addition to these features, we wanted to also try and promote health and wellness by using a simple pedometer to 
motivate progress in the game. This way, the more steps you take, the more your Augmon character grows and strengthens.

This app is a project that I worked with 5 other teammates for our Mobile Development Course in Winter 2015 at UCSD.
My main responsibility was deploying a LAMP backend server on Amazon EC2 and provide a web api and integrating Google analytics
as well as implementing a local database using SQLite and C# for the application.

Design, Technologies, and Tools used:
- C#
- Unity3d
- Qualcomm Vuforia (Augmented Reality)
- Google Mateiral Design
- Google Analytics v3
- RESTful API
- Amazon EC2 LAMP Server - (Ubuntu Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP)
- SQLite
- Facebook Login Integrated
- Android SDK (Pedometer and GPS location)
